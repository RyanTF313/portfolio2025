      "Born April 3rd, 1993 in Detroit, MI I spent most of my young life in Detroit. I lived in a few different places, Texas and Virginia being the most impactful, but I always made my way back home. My upbringing in Detroit gave me a fierce determination when it comes to accomplishing my goals and striving to do more with my life. My travelling exposed me to how large the world was and the many cultures existing beyond the 313 area code. With the combination from what I learned at home and abroad I used those skills to mold my life into what it is today.",

      "In the fall of 2017 I left Detroit again to go back to school in an effort to change my perceived trajectory of my life. After the move I started to learn how to code, probally the best 'ah ha' moment I have had in my life. I found a career I enjoy that will challenge me to be better everyday. While starting my coding journey I was fortunate to have joined the best tech community in Resilient coders which has been a major help in my career thus far. After finishing their bootcamp in 2018 I landed my first role as a Web Applications Developer.",

      "I began my first step into tech in a couple ways. Technically speaking my first role was a part time teaching position with a organization that taught children at middle and elementary schools. Great time but it was part time and I needed a full time role, as I still worked overnight I spent my days off from teaching doing the job search hustle. Step one upskill, step two apply, step three interview. I continued that dance for a few weeks until I landed my first full time offer as a Web Applications Developer.",

      "After starting my first full time role I struggled immensly. Oddly enough it was with what seemed like everything but my technical skills. I struggled fitting in with my coworkers. I struggled with feeling like I didn't belong. I struggled with feeling respected/disrespected. The common feeling we all feel at some point is I struggled with imposter syndrome. Luckily I did have aa friend that graduated the program with me so even though I struggled with these things it was comforting for my friend (who remains a good friend of mine till this day) stand in the fire with me and be someone I could talk to and ask for help. For a time I thought about giving up my carrer in coding but my friend and mentor had other plans. With his help and introduction I would then land my next role as a full time bootcamp instructor. I poured all the things I felt like I needed into those taking my lessons. Helping others learn helped me fall deeper in love with coding not to mention the upskill efforts seemed to feel seemless. As I learned new things it was easy to see the correlation of what i knew before and then breaking things down to bite size pieces for my developers made me the engineer you see today.",

      "Even though I love teaching it just wasn't a good enough salary to take care of myself and help my loved ones. With that in mind I started searching for my next role. I accepted an offer as a software engineer on the digital team of an energy company. I got my first exposure to working for a tech centric team. We focused on the product and our users. We even got to meet them, spend time with them for a couple days, and get direct immediate feedback. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end. After a couple annual reviews and no sign of a chance to progress my career I began the search again.",

The team was very knowledgable and welcomed me, I honestly never had lunch alone even when I worked remotely. Unfortunately tragedy struck me and my family and my work took a nose dive. I lost my younger cousin who was like a little brother to me, then lost my little brother a few weeks later, then lost a distant cousin days later, then immediately after that my moms kidney failure gotten worse putting her on dialysis. I was lost to be honest. Everything felt important but it is impossible to split your focus, I learned this the hard way, I lost my role during this time.",
